The CSS code uses an invalid property or value, such as `font-size: larger` (should be `font-size: larger;` or a specific size like `font-size: 16px;`), or a non-existent selector.  Another common issue is incorrect nesting of selectors leading to unexpected behavior or no styling applied.  Specificity conflicts can also be a source of errors. For example, an inline style might override a more general style defined in an external stylesheet.
