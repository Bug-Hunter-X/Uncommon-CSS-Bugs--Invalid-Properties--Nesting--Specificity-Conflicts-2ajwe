# Uncommon CSS Bugs
This repository demonstrates some uncommon bugs that can occur in CSS and their solutions. These bugs can be tricky to find and fix because they often don't result in explicit error messages from the browser. Instead, they manifest as unexpected visual behavior or missing styles.

## Bugs:
* **bug.css**: This file contains CSS code with invalid properties, incorrect selector nesting, and specificity conflicts.  These issues cause unexpected rendering in the browser. 

## Solutions:
* **bugSolution.css**: This file provides the corrected CSS code that addresses the errors in `bug.css`. It shows how to correct the property values, improve the selector structure, and resolve specificity conflicts to achieve the desired visual output. 

## How to run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. You should see the expected visual output after making the necessary correction from bug.css to bugSolution.css.  Inspect both files and see how specificity conflicts are resolved by using more specific selectors.
